This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Next.js Project using TypeScript with ESLint, Prettier, Husky & Github Workflow

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

You can also use this repo as a boilerplate to create next.js scalable application. Just don't forget to update the dependencies (if required).
